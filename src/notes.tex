\begin{abstract}
My personal notes on the contents of the 
Introduction to Machine Learning course held
by professor Elisa Ricci at the University of Trento.
These notes should provide a complete introduction
to the world of Machine Learning and also be the basis
for further courses on more deep topics in this area.
