\begin{abstract}
    My personal notes on the contents of the
    Introduction to Machine Learning course held
    by professor Elisa Ricci at the University of Trento.
    These notes should provide a complete introduction
    to the world of Machine Learning and also be the basis
    for further courses on more deep topics in this area.
